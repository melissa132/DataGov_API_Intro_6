            <p style="font-size: 24px;color: forestgreen;">The <em><strong>Sunken Gardens</strong></em> were established in 1911 when a plumber named George Turner, Sr. purchased the six acres that would later become a world famous botanical attraction. Using an elaborate maze of clay tiles, he drained an ancient lake on the property, leaving a rich muck soil that was ideal for his favorite hobby... gardening. Neighbors so enjoyed strolling through Mr. Turner's garden, that by the early 1930's he was charging a nickel for tours.  George's wife, Mrs. Eula Turner shared her husbands love of plants and played a large role in establishing the gardens as a landmark. Their children and grandchildren continued the family vision and created this unique tropical garden with its flowing ponds.</p>
